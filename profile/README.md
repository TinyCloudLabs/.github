# TinyCloud Labs

**What if you could use AI on your most sensitive data - and prove no one else
can see it?**

TinyCloud is private AI infrastructure that combines TEE-based compute and inference with sovereign data storage. We believe ownership comes before privacy - when you truly own your data, privacy follows.

## What We're Building

- **Verifiable AI Processing** - Run AI on confidential data inside Trusted
  Execution Environments with cryptographic proof of privacy
- **Sovereign Storage** - User-owned data spaces where you control access, not
  platforms
- **Developer-First SDKs** - Build privacy-preserving applications without the
  complexity
